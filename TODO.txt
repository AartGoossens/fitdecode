* Handle event_timestamp_12 in 'hr' messages

* FitDecoder
  * Create a dedicated 'decoder.py' module
  * Use FitReader to read all frames at once in order to store and structure
    them internally
  * FIT files should be stored separately
    * with easy access to 'header', 'crc' and 'file_id' frames
    * as well as other useful properties (?)
  * Proper handling of 'hr' messages in 'activity' files, by inserting hr data
    into 'record' messages and removing the 'hr' messages (eventually erasing
    empty FIT files; see cleanup() method below)
  * cleanup() method(s)
    * To remove unused message definitions
    * To remove empty FIT files (i.e. no data message)

* Project and CI
  * Pipenv
  * Travis CI
  * AppVeyor CI
  * .gitlab-ci.yml
  * Coverage.py???
  * Check for PyPy compliance once it's compatible with 3.6+ (3.5 only atm)

* Improve docs
